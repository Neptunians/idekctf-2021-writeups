The first edition of idekCTF brought some really nice and creative web challenges.

We solved almost all of the web challenges. We didn't have much time to work on generic pastebin, but the first look on it was also great.

We also solved some pwn, rev, misc, forensics and crypto challenges and **got 8th place!!**
